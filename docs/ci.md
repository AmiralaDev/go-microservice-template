Using Compose is an easy way to manage multi-container applications on any system that supports Docker.

```bash
docker-compose up -d # it runs all necessary docker images that is needed

docker-compose -f docker-compose.e2e-local.yaml up -d # it runs all necessary docker images for Testing environment
```
